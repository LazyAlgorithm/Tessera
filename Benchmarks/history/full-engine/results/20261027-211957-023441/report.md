# Standalone engine benchmark results

Milliseconds; lower is better. Median of per-run medians. Query timings are per batch of 1,000 queries. Whole-frame intervals include CPU/GPU synchronization and pacing; they are not GPU timestamps.

Read ../../README.md for scope and interpretation. Rendering uses different native pipelines and is not an equal-image-quality ranking. Scene-empty/scripts are native traversal versus explicit C# calls and are not ranked. CCD and character results require behavior checks.
