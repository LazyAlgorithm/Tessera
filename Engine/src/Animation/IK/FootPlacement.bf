/// (the object that moves over the ground) and name the two feet; the legs are the two bones above each foot.

/// It works on top of the clip: a foot the animation lifts for a step is still lifted, by the same amount, over
/// whatever the ground is doing there. It looks for the ground with the physics world, so the ground needs colliders,
/// and it only does anything while the game is playing. Set Ground Layer when the character's own collider would
/// otherwise be found first. Worked out on each machine from the ground there; nothing is sent.
