/// Holds the end of an arm or a leg on a target: a hand on a weapon's grip, a hand on a door handle, a foot on a
/// pedal. One component is one limb, so a character holding a rifle has two (one for each hand), and each can let go
/// and take hold again by itself: LetGo on the left hand while it throws a grenade, Grab when it comes back.
///
/// Tip is the hand or foot. The two bones above it are bent to reach (Middle and Upper name them when they are not
/// simply its parents). Target is any object: put empty objects on a weapon where the hands belong. Pole is an object
/// the elbow or knee points towards; without one the limb keeps bending the way the clip bends it, and a humanoid's
/// limb that is straight bends the natural way (elbows back, knees forward).
///
/// IK runs after the Animator and after every script's LateUpdate, so a clip plays underneath and the hands stay on a
/// weapon that sways or recoils. Weight blends between the clip's pose (0) and the target (1). It is worked out on
/// each machine; in multiplayer LetGo, Grab and FadeWeight called by the object's owner are followed everywhere, and
/// a target moves on other machines if it is shared like any other object.
