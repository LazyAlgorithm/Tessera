/// Asset packs: a built game's assets in one file (`game.tpak`) instead of loose files that anyone can open and
/// change. File > Build... makes the pack; a packed game mounts it by itself when it starts.
///
/// Everything the engine loads (scenes, prefabs, materials, models, textures, sounds, UI documents, shaders...)
/// comes from the pack when it is there and from disk when it is not, so nothing changes while developing. Game
/// code that reads its own data files should do it through this class, or Assets.ReadText / Assets.ReadBytes, for the
/// same reason:
///
///   let text = scope String();
///   if (Assets.ReadText("Data/levels.txt", text)) ...
///
/// A pack keeps assets from being opened or edited with ordinary tools, and a file that was changed anyway fails
/// its checksum and does not load. It is not encryption.
///
/// A build can split the assets: game.tpak holds everything shared, and each scene's own files (what only that
/// scene uses) go into a pack of their own, listed in packs.txt inside game.tpak. Changing one map then rewrites one
/// small file, which is all an update has to send. MountGame mounts them all; reading a file does not care which
/// pack holds it. In a browser the scene packs download after the game has started: SceneReady says whether a
/// scene's pack has arrived, and Request asks for it next. SceneManager.Load waits for it by itself.
