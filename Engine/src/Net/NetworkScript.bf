/// The engine reads the keyboard and mouse on the controlling player's machine, sends the controls to the server,
/// runs OnTick there and on that player's own machine at once (so there is no delay in their own view), and when
/// the two disagree puts the object back to the server's state and runs the missed ticks again. Other players see
/// the result. With no session it simply runs every tick with the local controls.
///
/// Rules that keep that working:
/// - Take controls only from the TickInput, never from Input: OnTick also runs on the server, and is run again
///   after a correction.
/// - Move the object through its Transform, Rigidbody or CharacterController. Their state is what gets corrected.
///   Other fields are not rewound; mark ones clients need to see with [Sync] and change them on the server.
/// - OnTick may run several times for one tick on the controlling machine. Things that must happen once, such as
///   playing a sound or spawning something, belong in an `if (IsServer)` or `if (!IsReplaying)` block.
///
/// The object needs a Network Identity; one is added when a session starts if it is missing.
