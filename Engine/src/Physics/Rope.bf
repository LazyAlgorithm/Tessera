/// A rope (docs/soft-bodies.md "Ropes"): from the object in Start Attached To (this object if none) to the one in
/// End Attached To, or hanging free. Tow or lift with it from code: `Rope.Attach(truck, trailer)`.
/// It sags, swings, drapes over things and is pushed about by what moves through it, simulated as a chain of short
/// stiff lengths that resist bending and twisting (Jolt's Cosserat rods).
///
/// Each end is held where it is on its object, and moves with it. An end on a dynamic Rigidbody also pulls on it:
/// the two ends can get no further apart than the rope is long (it goes slack when they come closer), so a rope
/// holds up a crate, swings it, and is pulled tight by it. The pull acts along the straight line between the ends,
/// or, with Wraps Around on, round what the rope lies over (a rope over a beam works as a pulley). With a Break Force
/// it snaps in two when pulled harder than that.
///
/// The rope draws itself as a tube with the Mesh Renderer on this object (added if there is none).
///
/// In a network session the server ties, changes and snaps ropes (Attach, AttachStart, AttachEnd, LayAlong, Snap
/// and Break Force) on every machine; a client's call goes to the server, for a rope or object that player controls.
/// Each machine simulates the rope itself, between the shared objects.
