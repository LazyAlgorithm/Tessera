# Jobs: work spread over the cores

`Jobs.For(count, body)` runs `body(i)` for every `i` below `count` on the engine's worker threads and the calling thread together, and returns when every one has run:

```beef
Jobs.For(enemies.Count, scope (index) => enemies[index].Think());
```

- **Each body must only touch its own item's data.** Reading shared data that nothing changes during the batch is fine; writing it is not (no adding to a shared list, no moving objects in the scene, no graphics calls).
- `chunk` hands out that many items at a time, for cheap items (`Jobs.For(100000, body, 256)`), so the threads take turns less often.
- `minimum`: fewer items than this run on the calling thread alone (waking the workers costs a few microseconds).
- `Jobs.ThreadIndex` says which thread a body is on (0 the caller, 1 and up the workers, all below `Jobs.ThreadCount`), for scratch memory kept per thread.
- A `Jobs.For` started inside another (or from a second thread while one runs) runs on the calling thread.

There is one worker for each core but two (one is the calling thread's; the rest leave room for the physics and audio threads), up to 15. They start the first time a batch is big enough to share and sleep between batches. Web builds and one-core machines have none: everything runs on the calling thread.

## What uses them

- **Models bent on the CPU** (Skinned Mesh Renderers without GPU skinning): the frame's models are bent together at the end of `Scene.Update`, once animation, scripts and IK are done. 100 characters of 5,184 vertices: 13 ms to 4.2 ms.
- **Navigation paths**: what Navigation Agents ask for during `Update` is found together after it (`NavigationData.FindPaths`), each thread with its own search memory. Reading an agent's `Path`, `HasArrived`, `PathFailed` or `RemainingDistance` before then finds that agent's path at once, so scripts see the same thing as before.

Both wait for the batch only inside `Scene.Update`: called on their own (an editor tool calling `OnFrame`, a test calling `Update`), they do their work at once.
