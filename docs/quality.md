# Graphics quality presets

Players have machines from phones to big desktops. **Quality** gathers every graphics setting that trades looks for speed into four presets, **Low**, **Medium**, **High** and **Ultra**, applies them to the engine at once, and remembers the player's choice between runs. A game's options screen needs only a few lines.

**High** is what the engine always did, so a project that never touches Quality looks exactly as before.

## What each preset sets

| Setting | Low | Medium | High | Ultra | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Render Scale | 0.7 | 0.85 | 1 | 1 | Share of the window's resolution the 3D scene is drawn at; the interface stays sharp (`RenderView.RenderScale`). |
| Antialias | off | on | on | on | Multisampled edges (`RenderView.Antialias`). |
| Shadows | on | on | on | on | Sun and spotlight shadows (`RenderView.ShadowsEnabled`). |
| Shadow Map | 1024 | 2048 | 4096 | 4096 | Shadow map size in pixels; smaller is blurrier and cheaper (`RenderResources.SetShadowAtlasSize`). |
| Shadow Distance | ×0.5 | ×0.75 | ×1 | ×1.5 | Times each scene's Shadow Distance (`RenderView.ShadowDistanceScale`). |
| Ambient Occlusion, Depth of Field, Motion Blur | off | AO only | on | on | The costly screen effects (`ScreenEffects`); a scene's own settings still decide whether it uses them. |
| Detail Distance | ×0.6 | ×0.8 | ×1 | ×1.5 | How far away LOD Groups keep detail (`LODGroup.Bias`, docs/lod.md). |
| Foliage Distance | ×0.5 | ×0.75 | ×1 | ×1.5 | Times each Foliage's View Distance (`Foliage.DistanceScale`). |
| GPU Skinning | on | on | on | on | Bend characters on the graphics card (`GpuSkinning.Enabled`, docs/gpu-skinning.md). |
| Vsync | on | on | on | on | Wait for the screen's refresh (`Gfx.SetVsync`). |
| Texture Detail | half | full | full | full | Leaves out each texture's largest mip level: a quarter of the memory (`Textures.SkipLevels`, docs/textures.md). For textures loaded afterwards. |
| Anisotropic Filtering | off | on | on | on | Sharper textures on slanted surfaces (`Gfx.SetAnisotropic`). |
| Reflection Probes | off | on | on | on | Rooms mirrored by their reflection probes; off, shiny surfaces mirror only the sky (docs/reflections.md). |
| Reflection Size | 64 | 64 | 128 | 256 | A reflection probe's cube, in pixels (probes that do not choose their own). |

Changing any one setting from a preset makes the level **Custom**.

## In a game

```beef
// Options screen
if (pressedLow) Quality.Set(.Low);
Quality.Current.motionBlur = toggle;  // one setting
Quality.Apply();
Quality.Save();                       // remembered for the next run

// First run: nothing saved yet
if (!File.Exists(scope $"{GamePaths.PlayerData}{Quality.FileName}"))
	Quality.Set(Quality.Recommended);
```

At start the engine applies the player's saved settings by itself (`graphics.cfg` in the player data folder, one `name=value` a line). **Quality.Recommended** suggests Low on phones, Medium on built-in (Intel) graphics and in a browser, and High otherwise. `Quality.Level` says which preset is in use, for showing it in a menu.

The switch `--quality low|medium|high|ultra` sets a preset for one run (not saved), for checking how a game looks and runs on each.

## In the editor

**Window > Graphics Quality** shows the presets and every setting, applied at once to the Scene and Game views, to see what a player's Low or Ultra looks like while building a level. The editor does not read or write the player's saved settings. The editor switch `--quality-window` opens it.

## Networking

Nothing to send: quality is each player's own, and it changes only how things are drawn, never physics, gameplay or what the server decides. A dedicated server draws nothing.

## Compatibility

Projects and scenes are unchanged; with no `graphics.cfg` every setting is what it was before.

## Tests

`Tests/Quality` checks that High is the engine's defaults, that the presets rise from Low to Ultra, telling which preset settings are (and Custom), that applying reaches every engine setting and High puts all back, writing and reading settings (unknown lines skipped, values held in range), saving and loading the player's choice, the suggestion for phones, built-in graphics and browsers, and the `--quality` names.
