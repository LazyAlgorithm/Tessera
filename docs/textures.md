# Textures: mipmaps and compression

Every texture the engine loads gets **mip levels**, smaller copies of itself down to 1 by 1. A surface far away or seen at a slant samples a level whose pixels match the screen's, so it stays even rather than breaking into moiré and shimmering as the camera moves. **Anisotropic filtering** keeps such surfaces (a floor, a road, a wall seen along) sharp.

A built game also gets **compressed copies** of its pictures, in formats the graphics card reads as they are: a quarter to an eighth of the video memory, and quicker to load, since nothing is decoded.

Nothing needs setting up; a project's pictures are used as they are.

## Mip levels

Mip levels are made when a texture is loaded, from what it holds:

| Kind | Which | Averaged |
|---|---|---|
| Colour | Albedo, emissive and interface pictures; anything not below | In linear light, as the eye sees it: a black and white checker shrinks to a mid grey, not a dark one |
| Data | A material's metal / roughness and occlusion maps, lightmaps | As stored |
| Normal | A material's normal map, a model's normal images, and pictures named with "normal" (`rock_normal.png`) | As directions, made unit length again |

`--no-mipmaps` loads textures without them, to compare (the Sandbox's `Scenes/Textures.tscene`, a checker floor, shows the difference).

## Compressed copies

**File > Build** (and `tools/build_player.py`) makes `<picture>.ktx` beside each picture: **BC1** for opaque ones and **BC3** for see-through ones, with all their mip levels, made by bgfx's `texturec` (which the editor package ships). The engine loads the `.ktx` in place of the picture; the picture stays in the build for code that reads its pixels (colour grading lookups, the window icon).

Left alone:

- normal maps (these formats store colours as 5-6-5 bits, which bands directions badly);
- pictures under `UI/` and `Fonts/` (the project setting `textureCompressExclude = UI/*;Fonts/*` in `project.tessera`, `;`-separated patterns);
- images inside glTF / GLB models;
- web builds (browsers do not all read the same compressed formats).

The Build window's **Compress textures** turns it off for a project (`compressTextures = 0`), and `--no-texture-compression` for one build. `python3 tools/compress_textures.py <folder>` compresses a folder by hand. A running game's log ends with how many textures it made, how many were compressed and their size on the graphics card. `--no-compressed-textures` ignores the `.ktx` files, to compare.

BC7, which looks better than BC1, is not used: bimg's BC7 encoder takes most of a minute for one 512 by 512 picture.

## Quality

Two quality settings (docs/quality.md) belong here:

| Setting | Low | Medium, High, Ultra |
|---|---|---|
| **Texture Detail** (`textureDetail`) | half (the largest level left out: a quarter of the memory) | full |
| **Anisotropic Filtering** (`anisotropic`) | off | on |

Texture Detail applies to textures loaded after it changes; the editor's **Window > Graphics Quality** shows it, and how many textures there are and their size.

## In code

```beef
let handle = Textures.Create(pixels, width, height, .Data);   // RGBA8 pixels, with mip levels
Textures.Hint("Textures/mask.png", .Data);                    // before it is loaded
let kind = Textures.KindOf("Textures/rock_normal.png");       // .Normal
```

## Networking

Nothing to send: textures are drawn by each machine for itself. A dedicated server loads none.

## Compatibility

Projects, scenes and materials are unchanged. Distant textures look smoother than before. Built games are larger by the `.ktx` copies (about the size of the pictures again) and use far less video memory.

## Limits

- Mip levels of large textures loaded in the background are made on the main thread when the texture is added.
- A colour texture whose kind cannot be told (a mask with an ordinary name) is averaged as colour; `Textures.Hint` says otherwise.

## Tests

`Tests/Textures` checks the mip levels (sizes, odd sizes, leaving the largest out, colour in linear light, data as stored, alpha, normals kept unit length), what a texture holds (names, hints, a material's maps), and the quality settings. `python3 run.py` there also compresses a small project (BC1, BC3, plain rather than sRGB, all levels; normal maps, excluded folders and data maps), checks that mip levels stop the Textures scene's far floor shimmering as the camera moves, and that the compressed copies are used and look the same as the pictures.
